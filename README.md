- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- 👋 Hi, I’m @subham-sharma21
- 👀 I’m interested in crafting smart web apps, experimenting with AI agents, drone tech, and exploring the blend between electronics and code.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning and built a crying baby classifier using AI — because even babies deserve to be understood by machines.
- 💞️ I love collaborating on real-world problem-solving projects — especially in health-tech, or anything involving automation and design thinking.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I built a crying baby classifier using AI — because even babies deserve to be understood by machines.
- 🎯 I live by this dev motto: If it doesn’t work, fix the code. If it still doesn’t work, fix your mindset.
